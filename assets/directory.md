* `tool` contains codes for auxiliary tasks.

* All annotation files follow [MS COCO format](http://cocodataset.org/#format-data).  
* If you want to add your own dataset, you have to convert it to [MS COCO format](http://cocodataset.org/#format-data).  
  
If you have a problem with 'Download limit' problem when tried to download dataset from google drive link, please try this trick.  
```  
* Go the shared folder, which contains files you want to copy to your drive  
* Select all the files you want to copy  
* In the upper right corner click on three vertical dots and select “make a copy”  
* Then, the file is copied to your personal google drive account. You can download it from your personal account.  
```  


### Pytorch SMPL layer and VPoser
* For the SMPL layer, I used [smplpytorch](https://github.com/gulvarol/smplpytorch). The repo is already included in `common/utils/smplpytorch`.
* Download `basicModel_f_lbs_10_207_0_v1.0.0.pkl`, `basicModel_m_lbs_10_207_0_v1.0.0.pkl`, and `basicModel_neutral_lbs_10_207_0_v1.0.0.pkl` from [here](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/download.php) (female & male) and [here](http://smplify.is.tue.mpg.de/) (neutral) to `${ROOT}/smplpytorch/smplpytorch/native/models`.
* Download [VPoser](https://github.com/nghorbani/human_body_prior) from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KNw99d4-_6DqYXfBp2S3_4OMQ_nMW0uQ?usp=sharing) and place it under `${ROOT}/common/utils/human_model_files/smpl/VPOSERR_CKPT`.

### Output  
* Create `output` folder as a soft link form (recommended) instead of a folder form because it would take large storage capacity.  
* The experiments' directory structure will be created as below.
```  
${ROOT}  
|-- output  
|   |-- ${currrent_experiment_name} 
|   |   |-- log  
|   |   |-- checkpoint 
|   |   |-- result  
|   |   |-- vis  
```  
* `log` folder contains training log file.  
* `checkpoint` folder contains saved checkpoints for each epoch.  
* `result` folder contains final estimation files of MuPoTs generated in the testing stage.  
* `vis` folder contains visualized results.
